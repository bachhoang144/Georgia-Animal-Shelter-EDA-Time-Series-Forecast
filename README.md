# Georgia Animal Shelter Data Analytics Project

## Author: Bach Hoang Pham

### Introduction
This project delves into the analytics of animal shelter operations in Georgia, focusing on the insights that can be drawn from data to optimize shelter operations. Inspired by impactful initiatives like the Best Friend Shelter Dashboard and the Shelter National Database, this notebook aims to contribute to understanding and improving animal shelter operations on a more granular level, using Georgia's state-mandated shelter data.
